This was a compiler project for CPSC 411 in Winter 2022. It is based on a small subset of Java. The rough compiler specification can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20040813101727/http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/411/spec.html) (I did not save the specification when I took the course, but it looks similar enough on wayback machine)
